# Task 026 — Startup / initialization call chain (best current reconstruction)

Evidence-annotated chain from protector completion toward the Wizet runtime
and (projected) login/network. RVAs are CMS079-local static evidence;
`[runtime]` marks edges observed in Task 024/025/026 runs; `[static]` marks
disassembly-proven edges; `[projected]` marks edges expected but not yet
observed at runtime (blocked at the modal gate / post-modal depth).

## 2. Edge table

See `result/task026-call-edges.csv` (23 edges; 20 confirmed-static or
confirmed-runtime, 3 high/medium projected).

## 3. Where the chain is currently cut

- **Cut point A (runtime)**: step [3]->[4] — the modal. T26F3 carries the
  authorized single OK click + 300 s post-modal window; its dialogs.csv /
  module-first-seen.csv decide whether [5]+ happen naturally.
- **Cut point B (static)**: the exe-interior steps between [1] and [2]
  (the `0x862000+` encoded region incl. the drive-letter check). No safe
  static channel exists yet (decoder-C producer inside the region itself).
- **Cut point C (semantics)**: steps [5]-[8] ordering is inferred from
  import/export/structural evidence only; runtime module first-seen order
  from a successful post-modal run will pin the real sequence.
